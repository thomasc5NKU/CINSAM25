Welcome to the Web Development Camp resource repository! This collection includes four structured HTML/CSS templates designed for high school students participating in a summer camp focused on edge computing.
These templates are beginner-friendly and include common features like navigation bars, footers, and placeholder content. Students can choose a layout that fits their project them and customize it using their creativity and imagination. 

See the WebDevResources Directory for detailed information and resources related to this project.
